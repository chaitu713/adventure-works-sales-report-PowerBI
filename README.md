ADVENTURE WORKS SALES REPORT USING POWER BI

  Adventure Works Cycles, a global manufacturing company wants us to design a end-to-end business solution from scratch including tracking of KPIs (sales, revenue,         profit, returns), compare regional
  performance, analyze product-level trends and forecasts, and identify high-value customers.

  We're given a folder of raw csv files, containing information about transactions,
  returns, products, customers and territories.

  Here we used Power BI Desktop to:

    • Connect and transform the raw data
    • Build a relational data model
    • Create new calculated columns and DAX measures, and finally
    • Design an interactive report to analyze and visualize the data.
